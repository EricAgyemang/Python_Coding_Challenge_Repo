    "\n",
    "Linear regression assumes a linear or straight line relationship between the input variables ($X$) and the single output variable ($y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, that output ($y$) can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables ($X$). When there is a *single input variable*, the method is referred to as a **Simple Linear Regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple linear regression we can use statistics on the training data to estimate the coefficients required by the model to make predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line for a simple linear regression model can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = b_0 + b_1 × x$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b_0$ and $b_1$ are the coefficients we must estimate from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the coefficients are known, we can use this equation to estimate output values for $y$ given new input examples of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires that you calculate statistical properties from the data such as mean, variance and covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the algebra has been taken care of and we are left with some arithmetic to implement to estimate the simple linear regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, we can estimate the coefficients as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "b_1 =& \\sum((x_i - \\bar{x})\\times(y_i - \\bar{y})) / \\sum((x_i - \\bar{x})^2) \\\\\n",
    " =& ~~~Covariance(x, y) / Variance(x) \\\\\n",
    " b_0 =& ~~~\\bar{y} - b_1 \\times \\bar{x}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ refers to the value of the $i^{th}$ value of the input $x$ or output $y$. $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the mean value of the input $x$ or output $y$."

    "#The Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we are provided with a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file called salary.csv. The file is essentially a plaintext file, which contains 30 lines of information. Each line consists of two numbers (i.e., years of experience and salary) separated by a comma, such as \"1.1,39343\". Assuming an employee's salary ($y$) is approximately linearly increased with the number of years of working experience ($x$). Our task is to build a Simple Linear Regression (i.e., $y = b_0 + b_1 × x$).\n",
    "\n",
    "##**Here are the steps we intend to do:**\n",
    "1.   Open/Read the CSV file to a List, in which each item is also a List containing one pair of \"years\" and \"salary\". So after successfully loading the dataset, it will be saved to a List as [[\"1.1\", \"39343\"], [\"1.3\", \"46205\"], ...]. This list is similar to a $[2 \\times 30]$ array, representing 30 samples.\n",
    "2.   Split the dataset into a training set and a test set based on a ratio (e.g., $75\\%$ for training and $25\\%$ for testing).\n",
    "3.   Calculate Covariance and Variance of the training dataset to find out coefficients (i.e., $b_0, b_1$) \n",
