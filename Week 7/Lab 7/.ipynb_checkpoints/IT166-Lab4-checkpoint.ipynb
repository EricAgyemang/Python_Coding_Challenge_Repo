    "In this lab, we will practice how to cerate Python functions to calculate the same statistic parameters (e.g., mean, standard deviation) of a given population, as we did in Lab 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "* Be able to write Python functions to find minimal, maximal, mean, and standard deviation values of a collection of numerical data.\n",
    "* Be able to write Python functions that conduct sampling on a given porpulation.\n",
    "* Be able to write Python applications to use these functions.\n",

    "Preparation\n",
    "* Launch the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "* Rename the notebook page as “lab4”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please provide solutions to the problems below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistic properties (e.g., mean, standard deviation) of a population is important for data analysis. In reality, we usually cannot collect the complete dataset of a whole population. Thus, we often take random samples of the population and estimate these statistic parameters based on the samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sample of $n$ observations from a population, we can calculate estimates of the population mean, standard deviation, and various other population characteristics (parameters). Prior to obtaining the complete dataset, there is uncertainty as to which of all possible samples will occur. Because of this, estimates such as $\\bar{x}$, and $s$ will vary from one sample to another. The behavior of such estimates in repeated sampling is described by what are called **sampling distributions**. Any particular sampling distribution will give an\n",
    "indication of how close the estimate is likely to be to the value of the parameter being estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Central Limit Theorem** states that if you have a population with mean $μ$ and standard deviation $σ$ and take sufficiently large $n \\ge 30$ random samples from the population with replacement, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling can be done with or without replacement. If with replacement, the same data point could appear more than once in a sample. "
