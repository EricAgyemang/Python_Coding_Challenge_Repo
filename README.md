# Python programming coding challenge for python developers (IT166 , ISU)

# Course Description: 

  Introduction to computer programming in Python emphasizing algorithms for scientific applications and data analysis. 
  Prerequisites: Grade of C or better in MAT 121 or 145 or consent of the school advisor.


# Purpose: 
  * This course will enable students to solve simple problems and perform basic data analyses by creating programs in Python or R. 
  
  * This course is intended for students with little or no programming experience. The course will help students learn programming concepts, 
  data types, structures, and files, loading and storage of data, random generators and basic distributions, and simple statistical analysis and 
  plotting in Python or R.

# Student Objectives:

  ** Upon completion of this course, students should be able to
  
    1.	Design a solution to a problem.
    
    2.	Select and use appropriate data types to solve a problem in Python.
    
    3.	Employ appropriate control structures to solve a problem in Python.
    
    4.	Choose appropriate data structures to solve a problem in Python.
    
    5.	Create re-usable programs through defining simple functions.
    
    6.	Use arrays to solve numeric problems in Python.
    
    7.	Create programs that read and write files in Python.
    
    8.	Test and document Python programs.
    
    9.	Use elementary numeric techniques.
    
    10.	Evaluate simple datasets by calculating their descriptive statistics.
    
    11.	Experiment with simple charts and diagrams and choose an appropriate type for the problem at hand.
    
    12.	Apply machine learning modeling techniques for data predictions.
    
    13.	Experiment with data analysis packages in Python, R, and SQL.
