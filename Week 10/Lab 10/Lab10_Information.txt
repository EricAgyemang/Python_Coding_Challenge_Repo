Since reviews of much work on sentiment analysis
have already been included in in this section we will
only review some previous work upon which our research
is essentially based Hu and Liu summarized a list of
positive words and a list of negative words respectively
based on customer reviews The positive list contains 2006
words and the negative list has 4783 words Both lists also
include some misspelled words that are frequently present
in social media content Sentiment categorization is essentially
a classification problem where features that contain opinions or
sentiment information should be identified before the classification
For feature selection Pang and Lee suggested to remove objective 
sentences by extracting subjective ones They proposed a
text-categorization technique that is able to identify subjective content
using minimum cut Gann et al. selected 6799 tokens based on Twitter data
where each token is assigned a sentiment score namely Total Sentiment Index
featuring itself as a positive token or a negative token
